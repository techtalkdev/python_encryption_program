# 🔐 Python Encryption Program

A simple terminal-based encryption and decryption tool using basic character substitution. This project demonstrates how to scramble messages using a shuffled key made from letters, digits, punctuation, and spaces.

## 💡 Features

- Encrypt any text using a randomized substitution cipher
- Decrypt messages using the generated key
- Uses printable characters including spaces, punctuation, digits, and letters
- Beginner-friendly Python script

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Generates a randomized key from all printable characters.
2. Replaces each character in your message with its mapped counterpart from the shuffled key.
3. Reverses the process to decrypt a message.
